# Customer Dashboard
This is an analysis of my Excel dashboard with visualization analyzing the customer data provided by Quantum Analytics NG.


The essence of this dashboard is to know how many customers we have, the average revenue generated by each of the customers and the total revenue that all the customers has generated.

The dashboard also gives information of the revenue generated from each of the customer value and also suggest the year that was most profitable.

The customer count by gender was also insighted and you can find lots of other interesting insights you might love to take a look at.

Thank you.
